# youtube-plus
A YouTube theme

# NOTICE
This theme is in its early stages. Expect lots of bugs, inconsistencies, frequent updates and the like. It's not compatible with the light theme yet, and I can't guarantee it'll work on anything but Chrome.

Proceed at your own risk.

# Installation
## Chrome, Chromium, Opera
- Install [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe)
- Open styles.css 
- Copy the text
- Click "Manage styles" in Stylish
- Make a new theme
- Paste the code
- Call it something
- Save it

## Firefox
Unfortunately, I haven't tested the code on Firefox yet. The steps should be similar to Chrome, but I can't guarantee it'll work.

## Safari
Unfortunately, I haven't tested the code on WebKit yet. The steps should be similar to Chrome, but I can't guarantee it'll work.

# Screenshots
Note: the screenshots below are development screenshots and do not represent a final product of any kind. They'll be updated periodically along with the theme.
